  !!! NOTE !!! THIS DOCUMENTS THE RIPPLE NEURO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEV SPEC.

  This data format provides a method for encoding digitized extracellular
  spikes, stimulation waveforms, and digital input events from up to 512
  electrodes (future revisions of the specification will provide higher
  counts). This format represents a balance between flexibility to encode a
  variety of different event types, efficiency of encoding, and simplicity of
  organization for quick analysis.

  A *.NEV file is composed of three sections:

  1) Header Basic Information

    A series of fixed-width fields containing information about timebase,
    authoring application, extended headers, and any user generated comments.

  2) Header Extended Information

    A variable number of fixed-width packets which hold data about the
    configuration of individual electrode channels and other important
    experiment information.

  3) Data Packets
    A series of fixed-width packets containing continuous data from
    individual electrodes.

  file_header:
    doc: |
      This is the first section in the NEV file. It contains one header with
      the following fields (in the order listed). All multi-byte data types are
      stored in little-endian format.
    seq:
      - id: file_type_id
        contents: NEURALEV
        doc: Always set to "NEURALEV" for "neural events".
      - id: file_spec
        type: filespec
      - id: additional_flags
        type: u2
        doc: |
          File format additional flags. Bit 0: Set if all spike waveform values
          in the file are 16-bit; un-set if a mixture is to be expected.
          In the un-set case you MUST look at NEUEVWAV to determine the number
          of bytes per waveform sample. All other bits are reserved and should
          be set to 0.
      - id: bytes_in_headers
        type: u4
        doc: |
          The total number of bytes in both headers (Standard and Extended).
          This value can also be considered to be a zero-indexed pointer to the
          first data packet.
      - id: bytes_in_data_packets
        type: u4
        doc: |
          The length (in bytes) of the fixed width data packets in the data
          section of the file. The packet sizes must be between 12 and 256
          bytes (see Data Section description). Packet sizes are required to be
          multiples of 4 so that the packets are aligned for 32-bit file
          access. Referred to as Packet_width in Nev Data Packets section.
      - id: time_resolution_of_timestamps
        type: u4
        doc: |
          This value denotes the frequency (counts per second) of the clock
          used to specify sample time.
      - id: time_resolution_of_samples
        type: u4
        doc: |
          This value denotes the sampling frequency (samples per second) used
          to digitize neural waveforms.

        type: strz
        size: 32
        doc: |
          A 32-character string labeling the program which created the file.
          Trellis will also include its revision number in this label.
          The string must be null terminated.
      - id: comment_field
        type: strz
        size: 200
        doc: |
          A 200-character, null-terminated string used for embedding user
          comments into the data field. Multi-line comments should ideally use
          no more than 80 characters per line and no more than 8 lines.
          The string must be NULL terminated.
      - id: reserved
        size: 52
        doc: Reserved for future information (written as 0).
      - id: processor_timestamp
        type: u4
        doc: |
          The processor timestamp (in 30 kHz clock cycles) at which
          the data in the file were collected.
      - id: number_of_extended_headers
        type: u4
        doc: A long value indicating the number of extended header entries.

  extended_header:
    doc: |
      This section of the NEV file contains a variable number of 32-byte,
      fixed-length headers. The exact number of headers in this section is
      specified at the end of the Basic Header section (see above). These
      headers may be used to include additional configuration information and
      comments into the file.

      Each 32-byte header consists of an 8 byte identifier and a 24 byte
      information field. These headers are not required to be of any registered
      type. For example, a program can add extended headers to the NEV file
      that only the program or related programs can utilize. However, there are
      several standard entries and identifiers that are defined in the
      specification and listed below with the 8 character identifier and 24
      byte information field.

      Note: For NEUEVWAV headers, the Stim Amp Digitization Factor is set to 0
      for neural waveforms, and the Neural Amp Digitization Factor is set to 0
      for stimulation waveforms. Stimulation channels have associated NEUEVWAV
      and NEUEVLBL headers but not NEUEVFLT headers.
