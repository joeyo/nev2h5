  NFx files have the extension .NFx where x is some number between 1 and 9.
  This file type is used to store information and data for channels which are
  sampled continuously (e.g., Hi-Res data for EMG). All data are written in a
  time non-decreasing manner in 32-bit floating point format (IEEE 754 single
  precision). A file with the extension .NFx will often be accompanied by a
  .NEV file with the same base name: for instance, data.nev and data.nf2. The
  existence of a single extended NFx file does not require or preclude the
  existence of other NFx files. Moreover, the NFx files will not necessarily
  start with .nf1; the combination of data.nev and data.nf2 is perfectly valid.

          A time stamp of zero corresponds to the beginning of the data

          time of the file creation are stored in the file header.

          This corresponds to a single data collection point.  There will be
          exactly "Channel Count" number of values per data point. They will be
          sorted in the same order as they are presented in "Channel ID". Data
          will be stored as digital values.
